            <h3>Queen of Rock and Roll</h3>
            <p>
              Joan Jett is a gifted multi-talented artist. She is a guitarist,
              songwriter, record producer, and actress. “As frontwoman for the
              Runaways, Joan Jett became a female pioneer in the male-dominated
              world of rock music.”

              Born Joan Marie Larkin on September 22, 1958, in Wynnewood
              Pennsylvania. She received her first guitar at 14 years old. She
              began lessons but quit shortly after because her teacher would
              only give her folk songs and believed that women should not play
              rock. She formed her first serious band at 16 years of age, an
              all-female band called 'The Runaways'. Jett went solo after the
              band called it quits in 1979. She is the founder and lead of her
              band 'Joan Jett and the Blackhearts'. After rejections from record
              labels Jett and Kenny Laguna founded Blackheart Records in 1980.
              This made her the first female artist to own and have direct
              control over an independent record company. She is in the Rock and
              Roll Hall of Fame and has many other great honors

              By Hook or By Crook, and others. Jett continues to produce her
              music as well as sign others to her record label. She is a
              philanthropist, is active with Farm Sanctuary and PETA, as well as
              devotes much time to other social causes.
